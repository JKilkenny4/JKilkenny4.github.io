											<p class="style1">I'm a data-phile based in Philadelphia always looking to explore new ideas, technologies, and projects. 
												I received a M.S. in Experimental Psychology from Saint Joseph's University in 2019. 
												My thesis research explored how college-aged offspring who grew up with helicopter parents coped with stress.
											</p>
											<p class="style1">While at Saint Joe's, I also conducted research into traumatic brain injuries, the effects of early life and adolescent stress, emotion regulation, and cognitive responses to stress.
												It's also where I developed a passion for statistics and data science.
												Advanced research methods and statistics were my favorite classess by far, and I was privileged enough to be able to work as a TA for both undergraduate and graduate statistics courses.
											</p>
											<p class="style1">After graduating, I began working in market research consulting for various pharmaceutical and bio-tech clients.
												My work spans both quantitative and qualitative research depending on the needs of the project, but I specialize in large-scale longitudinal tracking studies. 
												I have experience in both patient and HCP research, and I have worked in a number of different therapeutic areas including oncology, neurology, and rheumatology, among others. 
											</p>
											<p class="style1">Much of my free time is spent coding and work on side projects.
												I am confident coding / working in Python, R, SQL, and SPSS, comfortable using project management tools such as Git and Docker, and experienced building dashboards in Looker.
												I enjoy reading about new statistical and ML approaches, and I'm currently interested in exploring unsupervised and reinforcement learning more.
												I've been slowly reading through Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Sutton and Barto over the last few weeks, so I'm especially looking forward to building some Monte Carlo simulations in the future.
											</p>
											<p class="style1">I'm also an avid golfer, which tends to occupy the rest of my free time, for better or worse.
